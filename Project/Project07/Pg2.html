    <p>Education is something all players must have when it comes to Tillie's Touch. Having good grades can and will get these Tillie's Players to the collegiate level if they want to play at that level. Dale makes sures every player has good grades. So tutors like Riley Murphy who is a student at Syracuse University is mostly helping with the tutoring. There are many other tutors as well. As shown in the first picture you can see Matt Johon, who is Dale Johson's son. Many students use the time for practice to do academics first and then be able to play if they have time.</p>
