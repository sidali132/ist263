        My name is Sidali Mohamed a sophomore in the ISchool majoring in Information Management & Technology, concentrating in Information Security. I am interested in protecting data and how data can be used in a bad way. Also, how hackers are able to change their tactics on hacking people and finding solution to prevent that from happening. As technology changes ways to protect data may change. I also work at the School of Educationâ€™s IT department hoping to increase my knowledge and experience in IT.

	My hobbies are playing soccer, working out, and Anime. I played soccer since I was a young and played in high school at the varsity level since sophomore year in high school. I was captain of my soccer team my senior year and also the captain of my travel team as well. I played for Tillies Touch.  I wrestled in high school at the varsity level as well. I watched a lot of anime but my favorite one would be One Piece. There are others I also liked for example Hunter X Hunter, Naruto, Bleach, Dragon Ball series, Attack on Titan, and a few new generation animes. For the new gen I would Demon Slayer, Jujutsu Kaisen, and maybe Tokyo Revengers. There are short animes I watched like Erased.
