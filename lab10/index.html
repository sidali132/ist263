        <p>  My name is Sidali Mohamed a sophomore in the ISchool majoring in <strong>Information Management & Technology, concentrating</strong> in <strong>Information Security</strong>. I am interested in protecting data and how data can be used in a bad way. Also, how hackers are able to change their tactics on hacking people and finding solution to prevent that from happening. As technology changes ways to protect data may change. I also work at the School of Education’s IT department hoping to increase my knowledge and experience in IT.</p>
